  ## Introduction

   This is a fully responsive and functional React web application. While practicing my React and JavaScript fundamentals I also built an Express.js api and used libraries such as MaterialUi and Toastify to add some flare to the front end. 

  ## Technologies

  - JavaScript
  - React
  - Redux
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Router V6
  - Express
  - Material UI
  - Toastify
  - Email.js


  ## Features

  This application allows users to navigate to many different pages to add a dynamic feel to the application. This application fetches data from a NASA api as well as an api that I built. I also implemented Redux to allow users to add and remove selected rover landing information from a gallery page. This application also comes equipped with a fully functional form via Email.js

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Some future extensions that I would like add to this application is to improve performance as well as add a login page. 

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
